# Contributing

Make your contributions by pull request.

## How to
* Create an pull request for adding a site at this list
  * The pull request must be in the format: `* add - site name`
* Add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - description
* Add a section if needed.
    * Add the section description.
    * Add the section title to Table of Contents.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.

Just a gentle reminder: **Try not to submit your own project. Instead, wait for someone finds it useful and submits it for you.**
